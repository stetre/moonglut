== Preface

This is the reference manual of *MoonGLUT*, which is a 
http://www.lua.org[*Lua*] binding library for 
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net[*FreeGLUT*]. 
footnote:[
This manual is written in
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc], rendered with
http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] and a CSS from the

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with both FreeGLUT and the Lua programming language.

For convenience of reference, this document contains external (deep) links to the 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html[Lua Reference Manual], the 
http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/docs/api.php[FreeGLUT API documentation] and the
https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/spec3/spec3.html[GLUT API documentation].

=== Getting and installing

The *official repository* of MoonGLUT is on GitHub at the following link:
*https://github.com/stetre/moonglut* .

MoonGLUT runs on GNU/Linux and requires 
*http://www.lua.org[Lua]* version 5.3 or greater, and
*http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download[FreeGLUT]* version 3.0.0 or greater.

To install MoonGLUT, download the 
https://github.com/stetre/moonglut/releases[latest release] and do the following:

[source,shell]
----
# ... download moonglut-0.1.tar.gz ...
[ ]$ tar -zxpvf moonglut-0.1.tar.gz
[ ]$ cd moonglut-0.1
[moonglut-0.1]$ make
[moonglut-0.1]$ make check
[moonglut-0.1]$ sudo make install
----

The _$make check_ command shows you what will be installed and where (please read
its output before executing _$make install_).
By default, MoonGLUT installs its components in subdirectories of `/usr/local/`
(and creates such directories, if needed).
This behaviour can be changed by defining PREFIX with the desired alternative 
base installation directory. For example, this will install the components
in `/home/joe/local`:

[source,shell]
----
[moonglut-0.1]$ make
[moonglut-0.1]$ make install PREFIX=/home/joe/local
----

=== Module organization

The MoonGLUT module is loaded using Lua's 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-require[require]() and
returns a table containing the functions it provides 
(as usual with Lua modules). This manual assumes that such
table is named *glut*, i.e. that it is loaded with:

[source,lua,indent=1]
----
glut = require("moonglut")
----

but nothing forbids the use of a different name.

=== Examples

A few examples can be found in the *examples/* directory of the release package.

=== License

MoonGLUT is released under the *MIT/X11 license* (same as
http://www.lua.org/license.html[Lua], and with the same only requirement to give proper
credits to the original author). 
The copyright notice is in the LICENSE file in the base directory
of the https://github.com/stetre/moonglut[official repository] on GitHub.
